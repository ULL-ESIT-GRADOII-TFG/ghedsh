# Summary and Conclusions {#summary-and-conclusions}

While aplications given for GitHub do exist, I belive my work has created a good alternative, providing more functionalities and a new perspective of usage. In addition, to be able to work and learn simultaneously about the real necessities of a teacher, adds more value to this project in comparison to the official applications in matters of utility.

The creation of this project has helped me to earn more experience with the usage of the API system, and has also improven my knowledge of Ruby.It has also given me the opportunity to develop a program bearing its installation in another system in mind, and that was a valuable experience.

Regarding my future work about this application, I pretend to add new utilities and revise the program usage not only from a teacher&#039;s but also from a pupil&#039;s point of view.I hope that it will be possible to update data between this project and the official applications, which cannot yet be done.

I want to express my gratitude towards my tutor, Casiano Rodríguez León, for giving me the oportunity to create this project, and for all his help. To be able to create something out of a necessity, and to think and look for solutions to concrete problems, has been one of the main reasons I have always wanted to become a computer engineer. Therefore, working on this project has been very satisfactory for me, and I strongly believe that it was the best way to finish my career while reafirming myself about my future profesional projects.

Thank you for reading this memory. I hope that you enjoyed my work.
